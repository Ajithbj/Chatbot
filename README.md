# Chatbot

The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories(intents), patterns, and
responses.

Using LSTM to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then we
will give a random response from the list of responses.

Successfully designed and executed the integration of a chatbot utilizing Python, resulting
in a substantial 80% accuracy in the performance of output.
